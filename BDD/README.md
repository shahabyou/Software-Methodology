# BDD Behavior-Driven Development
BDD is an agile methodology encourages collaborative among developer and customer representatives. BDD is collaboratively defines software behavior with the help of concrete example. It facilitates software testing from perspective of well understood and well defined software features written in business languages.
# TDD Test Driven Development
Write test and then write code to make test complile successfully. So code should satisfy test scenario. The key thing that I want to highlight here is, as you implement step definitions (test), you are going to find things that are missing and need to be implemented. This is because we are doing test driven development.

# Key component of Cucumber
1. Feature file
2. Step definition
3. Test runner

Each Feature consists of different Scenarios and each Scenario consists of different Steps. All write with a language called Gherkin.

Feature file documents common understanding of business requirments. We write scenario written in business language that non developer could understand. So it becomes ultimate source of truth for all stakeholders.
