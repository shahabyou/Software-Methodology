## The Scrum Team

### Scrum master role
The most important thing to know about a scrum master is to recognize that the role is not the same as a project manager. The role isn't focused on defining a schedule, assigning tasks, and managing the work until it's done.The scrum master helps the product owner stay within the process framework.
1. First helping the product owner ensure the backlog is in good order and ready for the next sprint.
2. Second, they also ensure the product owner doesn't demand too much from the team in any sprint. 
3. Next, the scrum master helps the development team perform at the highest level possible.
   1. First, the scrum master protects the development team from outside distractions.
   2. Second, protrct against overcommit and overwork prusure or burnout.and rightsizing over commitment.
   3. Third, the scrum master protects the development team from complacency.  to help the development team identify further growth areas also to push the development     team to complete the most work they can with high quality. 
4.  Finally, the scrum master owns the scrum framework itself. as the process owner, scrum masters can make changes to the scrum processes. 

### Scrum master as servant leader
 1. Serves PO: Clarify goals and objectives , Coach best practicies, guide process and planing, facilate a scrum events and share knowledge
 2. Serves Dev Team: being self-organization and cross-functional, train scrum philosophy and values, guide on scrum framework, facilitating the development team in problem-solving, and removing impediments.
 3. Serves Org: Coaching Org to adopt scrum in the right way, Guide awareness and understanding, assisting their development teams to achieve the high performance the organization needs
 
### Product owner
 The PO, just as the name implies, is the sole accountable party for the product the development team is building. The PO, just as the name implies, is the sole accountable party for the product the development team is building. You can infer from this that the PO is responsible for maximizing the value the development team delivers. The Scrum process is dedicated to minimizing waste and maximizing value. Development teams minimize waste by only working on the right thing, they maximize value by working on the right thing at the right time, and completing the work with high quality. Thia become possible by keeping an ordered product backlog and PO is only porson who can change backlog.
 
### Product owner responsibilities
1. Clearly express  PBIs
2. Order PBIs efficiently 
3. Ensure backlog is accessable (visibale and available)
4. Clarify requirments
5. Provide status reports and forecast whatâ€™s coming up next in the backlog


### Development team
Development team size consists from 3 to 9 people. The whole focus of the development team is to produce a potentially shippable product increment at the end of the sprint. The work in this increment must be done at the end of the sprint even if the PO decides not to ship it yet.
1. Self-orginizing 
2. Cross-functional 
3. Does not acknowledge roles or titles

## Scrum Events

### Sprint planning
If the sprint itself is the heart of Scrum, then sprint planning is the lifeblood of the sprint. In sprint planning, the product vision and backlog are transformed into an actionable plan for the delivery of a product increment. 

The inputs to the sprint planning meeting:
1. Ordered product backlog
2. Completed last product increment. What you accomplished last sprint can influence what the team will do this sprint. 
3. The past performance of the development team. Usually known as velocity
4. The development team's capacity for the sprint.

the outcomes of sprint planning are:
1. the sprint goal.
2. the backlog items for the sprint
3. the plan for completing the work

### Daily scrum
According to the Scrum Guide, the guidelines for the daily scrum are that it's attended and facilitated by development team members. The scrum master doesn't attend the daily scrum, only ensures that it's taking place each day, and remains shorter than 15 minutes. However, according to the Scrum Alliance, the guidelines are a bit different. They are that the whole scrum team attends the daily scrum, any member of the scrum team can provide an update on scrum, and any interested party can attend the daily scrum, so long as they don't contribute. 

Each team member answers these three questions:
1. What did I do yesterday to help meet the sprint goal? 
2. What will I do today to help meet the sprint goal? 
3. what impediments do I have that are blocking me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?
The result of this information is awareness about how the team is progressing toward the goal and any obstacles that they need to tackle. 

### Backlog refinement 
- The product backlog is an ordered list of the requirements and ideas that are needed to build the product. Backlog refinement actually can mean two things:

1. First, it's an ongoing process the product owner uses to get more information about the needs and requirements for the product. The PO can delegate some of these tasks to other team members, but the accountability for the activity always remains with the PO.his refinement process is iterative and continues throughout the sprints
2. Secondly, it's an actual meeting scrum teams use after the midpoint in the sprint.

When you hold the refinement event, the PO presents the stories that are candidates for the next sprint. In this meeting, the development team has an opportunity to ask questions and get clarification on the work. When they do this, the development team is providing guidance to the PO on what additional information is needed to get the PBI ready for the coming sprint. what it means for an item to be ready for a sprint:

1. it's usually small enough to be completed in a single sprint.
2. any dependencies, upstream or down, are identified so they can be managed.
3. the story has been sized by the development team, meaning they know about how much work it will take to complete.
4. the acceptance criteria have been defined so the development team will know what done is for the story.

### Sprint review
While the daily scrum is intended for the scrum team to inspect and adapt within the sprint, the sprint review is the inspect and adapt event for the scrum team and their key stakeholders. During this event the product increment is the subject of inspection and adaptation.
 
 1. First, the PO provides an overview of the sprint goal, and the PBIs that were selected for inclusion in the sprint. 
 2. Next, the development team demonstrates the product increment and answers questions. The team can also share challenges faced and the solutions they found during the sprint.
 3. Then, the PO shares the product backlog and the next set of ordered PBIs.
 4. Next, the PO encourages open discussion with the stakeholders. 
 5. Finally, the PO adds appropriate feedback into the backlog, and may adjust it to meet the needs the stakeholders have shared. 

## Artifacts

### Product backlogs
There is one vehicle for all the work related to the product the scrum team is building, that's the product backlog. So long as your product exists, the product backlog exists. In short, the product backlog is an ordered list of all the work that needs to be done for the product. The work items listed in the product backlog are known as product backlog items, or PBIs. That means the product backlog lists all PBIs representing every feature, functionality, requirement, defect, and enhancement. When you think about ordering the work in the backlog, only the PO can set that order, or priority.  At the top of the product backlog are items the team knows the most about, are ready to be added to a sprint, and represent the highest value items for the product. Larger, less well understood, and less valuable items are at the bottom of the backlog. Through the process of backlog refinement, more detail is added to these PBIs. As their fine grain details are defined, they'll move up to the top of the product backlog when they represent sufficient value. 

### Sprint backlog 
This backlog is a subset of the product backlog and it's the list of PBIs the development team has selected to include in the sprint. The development team can change the sprint backlog during the sprint. They do this when they uncover new information and decide additional work is needed, or some work isn't needed after all
